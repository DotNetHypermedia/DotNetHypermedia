DotNet Hypermedia
===

There are a heap of Hypermedia projects in the .net space, each with some great ideas. The problem is each are locked to a different framework or only support a single formatter (HAL or Collection.json).

The goal of this project is bring us all together and create a library which all .net web frameworks can use to add Hypermedia support
